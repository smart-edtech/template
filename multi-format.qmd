Markdown is just a plain text format that is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly, easy to read.

For example:

```md
## Hello world

> The world is nice.

And this is **important** to _note_.
```

Will be rendered like this.

## Hello world

> The world is nice.

And this is **important** to _note_.
